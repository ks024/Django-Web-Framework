# Little Lemon Restaurant App - Final Project

## Overview

This module contains the code for the final project: the Little Lemon Restaurant App. The aim of this project is to evaluate the understanding of the course material. By completing it, you can identify the topics you have mastered as well as those that may require additional focus before finishing the course.

## Project Expectations

Throughout the course, you have encountered various exercises, knowledge checks, in-video questions, and other assessments. Everything included in the Django project will be within the scope of what you have already learned, so you are well-positioned to succeed.

### Project Details

Little Lemon is a charming neighborhood bistro that offers simple food and classic cocktails in a lively yet casual environment. The restaurant features a locally sourced menu with daily specials.

As part of the transition from a one-page website to a database-driven web application using the Django framework, the following pages have been completed:

- **Home**
- **About**
- **Book**

### Menu Page Requirements

For the menu page, the restaurant owners want to store menu information in a database that can be easily updated as the menu changes seasonally. Key functionalities include:

- Managers should be able to add or update menu items, modifying details such as name, description, price, and photo.
- Each menu item will have its own dedicated page that loads when users click on the item from the Menu page.
